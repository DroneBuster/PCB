Thus the SPI mode 0 (CPHA=0, CPOL=0) is the proper setting to control MMC/SDC, 
but mode 3 (CPHA=1, CPOL=1) also works as well in most case. A pull-up on the DO-pin cannot be omited, (butinas)
or some cards will fail to initialize.


Because DI and DO are normally high, they should be pulled-up. According to SDC/MMC specs, 
from 50k to 100k ohms is recommended to the value of pull-up registers


A low ESR capacitor, such as OS-CON, can eliminate the voltage dip dratiscally like shown in 'C'. 
However the low ESR capacitor can cause an oscillation of LDO regulator.
